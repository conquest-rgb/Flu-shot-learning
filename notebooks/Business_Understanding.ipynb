    "## 1.1 Background  \n",
    "During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, vaccination rates in many populations were lower than expected. To improve preparedness for future outbreaks, public health agencies need to understand the factors that influence vaccination decisions. The Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines dataset, based on a U.S. national survey, contains 26,707 individual records and 35 features. It provides demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal information, along with vaccination status for both H1N1 and seasonal flu. This makes it a valuable resource for exploring the drivers of vaccine uptake."
